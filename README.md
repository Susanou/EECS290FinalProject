# EECS290FinalProject
Final Project for the intro to game design class at CWRU

## Meeting 27/03/2020

Game ideas:

Using bread? 
Bread cats?
**Befriending your enemies**

- Beat the gluten
- Bread cats?

Game idea 1: titled bread game😎

Game Idea 2: Eating Bread simulator

Game Idea 3: Fight the Gluten
Cameron: “I’m constitutionally required to defend bread to my last breath”
Zubair: “Then you can create all the enemies!”

One proposed mechanic: You unzip, step into, and re-zip enemies

The mechanic we liked was befriending our enemies, or, if you will, buttering them up
Upgrades? Add different spreads, vary effectiveness or something based on what you run.

Storyline: 
Bread declared war on The Kingdom of Spread

Title:
Butter ‘em Up!

Who are we to start?
A minor noble of The Kingdom of Spread
    Allow some picking of titles, maybe 2 or 3 player sprites
Why do we fight bread?

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. A member of the Kingdom of Bread’s royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry the Crown Prince of Spread. On the day of the wedding, 


Spread friendship


Story

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. Crown Princess de Pâques of the Kingdom of Bread’s royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry Prince Nova Lox, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Spread. The wedding was beautiful, but the day after, Princess de Pâques awoke stale. The Baguette Guard too has come down with a strange affliction. They’re attacking… spread?

You have been called to retrieve the essential parts of the mythical Wash of Sweetness required to save her. The only problem? It seems that all of Bread has been affected by the curse laid upon Princess de Pâques and the recipe for the Wash of Sweetness is lost to time.


Mechanics
----

The more you sqve people from the curse the srtonger you become and the more spreads you have access to.
