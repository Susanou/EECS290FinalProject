Upgrades? Add different spreads, vary effectiveness or something based on what you run.

Storylines: 
Revenge for Avocado Toast
Bread declared war on The Kingdom of Spread

Butter ‚Äòem Up!

Who are we to start?
A minor noble of The Kingdom of Spread
    Allow some picking of titles, maybe 2 or 3 sprites
Why do we fight bread?

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. A member of the Kingdom of Bread‚Äôs royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry the Crown Prince of Spread. On the day of the wedding, 


Spread friendship

Story 1
--
 
Two kingdoms, the kingdom of bread and the kingdom of spread were friends. To cement their alliance, the only princess the kingdom of bread was to be married to the crown prince of Spread. But on the day of the wedding she was poisoned. Blaming the kingdom of Spread, Bread declared war on the kingdom to avenge their fallen princess. You're a [insert title (minor noble)] and you try to uncover the truth about the assassination of the princess of bread to save your kingdom from destruction.


Story 2 (going on this one)
--

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. Crown Princess de P√¢ques of the Kingdom of Bread‚Äôs royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry Prince Nova Lox, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Spread. The wedding was beautiful, but the day after, Princess de P√¢ques awoke stale. The Baguette Guard too has come down with a strange affliction. They‚Äôre attacking‚Ä¶ spread?

You have been called to retrieve the essential parts of the mythical Wash of Sweetness required to save her. The only problem? It seems that all of Bread has been affected by the curse laid upon Princess de P√¢ques and the recipe for the Wash of Sweetness is lost to time.
