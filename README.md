# EECS290FinalProject: Butter 'em Up!
Final Project for the intro to game design class at CWRU

Cameron: “I’m constitutionally required to defend bread to my last breath”
Zubair: “Then you can create all the enemies!”

Story
--

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. Crown Princess de Pâques of the Kingdom of Bread’s royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry Prince Nova Lox, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Spread. The wedding was beautiful, but the day after, Princess de Pâques awoke stale. The Baguette Guard too has come down with a strange affliction. They’re attacking… spread?

You have been called to retrieve the essential parts of the mythical Wash of Sweetness required to save her. The only problem? It seems that all of Bread has been affected by the curse laid upon Princess de Pâques and the recipe for the Wash of Sweetness is lost to time.


Mechanics
----

The different spreads are your different attacks. Each attack "saves" bread from the curse, recruiting them to your team.

The more people you save from the curse, the stronger you become. As you get stronger, you get access to different spreads.
