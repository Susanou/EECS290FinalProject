# EECS290FinalProject: Butter 'em Up!
Final Project for the intro to game design class at CWRU

Cameron: “I’m constitutionally required to defend bread to my last breath”
Zubair: “Then you can create all the enemies!”

Who is the player?
A minor noble of The Kingdom of Spread. The player can pick from a list of titles and 2 or 3 player sprites.

Story
--

Bread and Spread have always been on friendly terms, but in the face of gluten-free alternatives, they want to merge. Crown Princess de Pâques of the Kingdom of Bread’s royal family, the Couronnes, was set to marry Prince Nova Lox, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Spread. The wedding was beautiful, but the day after, Princess de Pâques awoke stale. The Baguette Guard too has come down with a strange affliction. They’re attacking… spread?

You have been called to retrieve the essential parts of the mythical Wash of Sweetness required to save her. The only problem? It seems that all of Bread has been affected by the curse laid upon Princess de Pâques and the recipe for the Wash of Sweetness is lost to time.


Mechanics
----

The different spreads are your different types of attacks

The more you sqve people from the curse the srtonger you become and the more spreads you have access to.
